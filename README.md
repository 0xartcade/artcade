# 0xArtcade

[Live Demo] Coming Soon

## What is the 0xArtcade?

0xArtcade, is a web3 mobile gaming platform and protocol that rewards players for interacting with digital art (NFTs)

Game are always free, but players can pay a small fee to *sign their scores* and publish to our on-chain scoring system. These scores recorded “on chain” and allow players to climb leaderboard, earn rewards and claim tickets that can be used to redeem at our on-chain reward store.

## Proof of Concept (ArtGuessr)

Our first proof of concept game will be powered by a game mode called ArtGuessr, inspired by the popular online game GeoGuessr. Each game is 5 rounds with players shown a random NFT from a specific collection (see game modes). Players are asked to guess metadata like the artist name, mint date, price, unique owners, rarity, etc. The players score is based on both the speed and accuracy of their guesses across all five round. 

## The Reward Store

Players earn virtual "tickets" when playing games in 0xArtcade and submitting their scores. These tickets can be redeemed in our "Reward Store" which will be stocked with NFTs minted by artists on Shape. Revenue generated for all 0xArtcade games will be split between 0xArcade, the Game Creators and the “Reward Pool” which will be used to purchase NFTs to stock the Reward Store.

## Expandability

0xArtcade is designed to allow anyone to build their own game based on NFTs. Our goal is to create a turn-key system for prototyping and creating games. We'll create simple tools for testing game UI/UI, retrieving and utilitzing on-chain data, and customizing each games reward system. Each game created contributes to the global reward pool and receives a share of 0xArtcade's transaction revenue.

## Why 0xArtcade

We believe in the power of decentralization and the future of web3. We believe that 0xArtcade offers a platform to not only engage players in real NFT art, but create an economic system that supports the purchase of art from real artists.
